# [Welcome to CENG 355](WelcomeLetter.md)

To re-familiarize yourself with the capstone series of courses take a look at 
[my project introduction](README.md).

For this course's weekly activities see the [Critical Path](355criticalpath2025jan-apr.md).

# CENG 355 Week 01
Typically the guidelines for each week will be in a file named ceng355wk______.md such as this week's ceng355wk01proposal.md. Your group's submission will be in the one mutually agreed upon CENG 317 repository selected to continue to be used as your group's CENG 355 repository with the filename(s) wk______.__ such as this week's [wk01proposal.md](wk01proposal.md) Often there will be a pre-existing template. By modifying and adding to the template file it becomes your submission, do not add unnecessary additional files. You will have to add your group members as collaborators on the repository that you choose.
